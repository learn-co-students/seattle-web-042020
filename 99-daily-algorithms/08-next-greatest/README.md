# Find the Next Greatest Number in an array

- You are given an array. For each element, print out that element and the next number in the array which is greater than it.

- If there is no element greater, print -1.

Example: 
```javascript
    nextGreatest([4,3,5])
    =>  {4:5, 3:5, 5:-1}
```

## Constraints
- The array will contain between 0-100 elements.
- Elements in the array will be constrained to 32-bit signed integers (whole numbers).
